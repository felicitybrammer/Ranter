# My Social!

## Description

My Social is a full-stack social media API built using a SQL database and following the Model-View-Controller paradigm. My Social allows you to create a user profile, to follow other users, to add posts and comments, and to like others' posts and comments too.
To use My Social, you'll need to create a user account first. To add other users' posts to your feed, you will need to search by username.
